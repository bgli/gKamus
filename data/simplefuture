Simple Future

Simple Future has two different forms in English: "will" and "be going to." Although the two forms can sometimes be used interchangeably, they often express two very different meanings. These different meanings might seem too abstract at first, but with time and practice, the differences will become clear. Both "will" and "be going to" refer to a specific time in the future.

FORM Will

[will + verb]

Examples:

    * You will help him later.
    * Will you help him later?
    * You will not help him later.

FORM Be Going To

[am/is/are + going to + verb]

Examples:

    * You are going to meet Jane tonight.
    * Are you going to meet Jane tonight?
    * You are not going to meet Jane tonight.

Complete List of Simple Future Forms

USE 1 "Will" to Express a Voluntary Action

"Will" often suggests that a speaker will do something voluntarily. A voluntary action is one the speaker offers to do for someone else. Often, we use "will" to respond to someone else's complaint or request for help. We also use "will" when we request that someone help us or volunteer to do something for us. Similarly, we use "will not" or "won't" when we refuse to voluntarily do something.

Examples:

    * I will send you the information when I get it.
    * I will translate the email, so Mr. Smith can read it.
    * Will you help me move this heavy table?
    * Will you make dinner?
    * I will not do your homework for you.
    * I won't do all the housework myself!

    * Don't worry, I'll be careful.
    * I won't tell anyone your secret.

USE 3 "Be going to" to Express a Plan

"Be going to" expresses that something is a plan. It expresses the idea that a person intends to do something in the future. It does not matter whether the plan is realistic or not.

Examples:

    * He is going to spend his vacation in Hawaii.

      B: Sue is going to make John's birthday cake.

USE 4 "Will" or "Be Going to" to Express a Prediction

Both "will" and "be going to" can express the idea of a general prediction about the future. Predictions are guesses about what might happen in the future. In "prediction" sentences, the subject usually has little control over the future and therefore USES 1-3 do not apply. In the following examples, there is no difference in meaning.

Examples:

    * The year 2222 will be a very interesting year.
    * The year 2222 is going to be a very interesting year.

    * John Smith will be the next President.
    * John Smith is going to be the next President.

    * The movie "Zenith" will win several Academy Awards.
    * The movie "Zenith" is going to win several Academy Awards.
